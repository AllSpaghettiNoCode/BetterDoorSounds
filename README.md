# BetterDoorSounds

This mod takes all the current door sounds (manor only for now, will push more out as updates) and replaces them with better ones.

Requires REPOLib and SoundAPI (my beloved)

All sounds replaced include:
- Door opening and closing
- Door slamming shut
- Door closing shut
- Door hinges breaking off
- Door soft and hard hits

More sounds will be added for the Arctic and Swiftbroom levels as well.
